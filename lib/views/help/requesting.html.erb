<dt id="which_authority">I'm not sure which department to make my request to; how can I find that out? <a href="#which_authority">#</a> </dt>

<p>It can be hard to untangle the complicated structure of government, and work out
who has the information you want. Here are a few tips:
<ul>
<li>Browse or search <%= site_name %>
looking for similar requests to yours.</li>
<li>When you've found a department you think might have the information, use
the "Home page of authority" link on the right hand side of their page to check what they say they do
on their own website.</li>
<li>Contact the department directly by phone or email to ask if they hold the kind of
information you're after.</li>
<li>Ultimately, don't worry too much about getting the right department. If you get it
wrong, they should advise you who to make the request to instead.
</li>
</ul>


<dt id="missing_body">You're missing the department that I want to request from! <a href="#missing_body">#</a> </dt>

<p>If the department is one of the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#annexa">Departments to which the Codeon Access to Information applies</a> then please contact us with the name of the department and,
if you can find it, their contact email address for Code on Access to Information requests.
</p>

<dt id="focused">Why must I keep my request focused? <a href="#focused">#</a> </dt>

<p>
Please put in your request only what is needed so that someone can
easily identify what information you are asking for. Please do
<i>not</i> include any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>arguments about your cause</li>
<li>statements that could defame or insult others</li>
<li>questions or requests for comment rather than for specific information</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you include extraneous material,
we may have to remove your request to avoid problems with
libel law, which is a pain for both you and us.
</p>

<p>
The site is only for hosting requests under the Code on Access to Information, not for general correspondence
with public authorities. Phrasing your request as a question or a request
for comment (e.g. "why are you doing X?" or "please
explain why you are doing X") makes it more likely that your message
will not be seen as a valid request, both by us and by the department.  Asking for "copies of all policies and procedures
regarding X" would, on the other hand, normally result in a valid request.

Remember: You are asking for records already held by the government. 
</p>

<p>
Short, succinct messages
make it easier for authorities to be clear what information you are
requesting, which means you will get a reply more quickly.

<dt id="responsible">How can I make responsible and effective FOI requests? <a href="#responsible">#</a> </dt>


We would encourage all our users to read
<a href="http://www.access.gov.hk">the Code on Access to Information itself</a>, along with the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/doc/guidelines.pdf">guidelines the civil service uses to interpret the Code</a>.




<dt id="fees">Does it cost me anything to make a request? <a href="#fees">#</a> </dt>

<p><a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#charges">Section 1.24 of the Code states in its entirety:</a></p>
<blockquote>Processing requests for information uses resources and departments may therefore require payment for this service. Any charges levied will reflect the cost of providing the information, and the information will not be released until the requisite payment has been made.</blockquote>

<p>The only charges explicitly mentioned on the <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a> website are <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/charges.htm">photocopying charges</a> of $1.1 per copy (A4 size) and $1.3 per copy (A3 size).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/doc/guidelines.pdf">guidelines</a> state that </p>
<blockquote> 
1.24.1 The policy of openness in government requires that charges for 
information provided in accordance with the Code be simple and inexpensive.  
Paragraph 1.24 reflects this, but is deliberately phrased in flexible terms to allow for 
adjustments to the charging regime.  Successful applicants for access to information 
should only be charged for the cost of reproducing the required documents, etc. at the 
current standard charge where one exists.</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
 
1.24.2 In all cases, applicants should be informed in advance how much they 
will have to pay for copies of documents they are seeking.  It is then their choice to 
pursue or abandon the request.  Departments are required to publish or make 
available for inspection a schedule of current reproduction charges. 
 </blockquote>


<dt id="format">Will I get the information in the format I want? <a href="#format">#</a> </dt>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/en/code.htm#responses">Code</a> states that 
<blockquote>So far as possible, information will be provided in the form in which it exists. Where disclosure of certain information in a record is to be refused, access will normally be provided to the remaining part of the record.</blockquote>
</p>




<dt id="quickly_response">How quickly will I get a response? <a href="#quickly_response">#</a> </dt>

<p>The Code states that
<blockquote>1.16 Where possible, information will be made available within ten [calendar] days of receipt of a written request. If that is not possible the applicant will be so advised by an interim reply within ten days of receipt of the request. The target response time will then be twenty-one days from receipt of the request.</blockquote>
</p>
and
<blockquote>1.18 Response may be deferred beyond twenty-one days only in exceptional circumstances, which should be explained to the applicant. Any deferral should not normally exceed a further thirty days.</blockquote>

<p>The guidelines state that 51 days is the maximum for a "complicated request", only in "exceptional circumstances", for example "the need to seek legal advice on a request", or "the need for an extensive search of files in order to meet the request".</p>

<p><%= site_name %> will email you if you don't get a timely response.  You can
then send the department a message to remind them, and/or tell them they
are potentially in breach of the Code.</p>



<dt id="no_response">What if I never get a response? <a href="#no_response">#</a> </dt>


<p>There are several things you can do if you never get a response.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sometimes there has been a genuine problem and the authority never
    received the request. It is worth telephoning the authority and politely
    checking that they received the request. It was sent to them by email.
    </li>
    <li>If they have not received it, the problem is most likely due to
      "spam filters". Refer the authority to the measures in the answer 
    '<a href="/help/officers#spam_problems">I can see a request on <%= site_name %>, but we never got it by email!</a>' 
    in the officers section of this help section. 
    </li>
    <li>If you're still having no luck, then you can ask for an internal review,
    and then complain to the Ombudsman about the department.
</ul>



<dt id="data_protection">Can I request information about myself? <a href="#data_protection">#</a> </dt>


<p>No. Requests made using <%= site_name %> are public, made under the Code on Access to Information, and cannot help you find information about a private
individual.</p>

<p>If you would like to know what information a public
authority holds about yourself, you should make a "Data Access Request" in private using the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance.
 <a href="https://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/publications/dataaccessright.html">The
PCPD's website</a> provides advice on accessing your
own personal information.</p>

<p>If you see that somebody has included personal information, perhaps
unwittingly, in a request, please contact us
immediately so we can remove it.</p>



<dt id="private_requests">I'd like to keep my request secret! (At least until I publish my story) <a href="#private_requests">#</a> </dt>

<p>Yes, it is possible for you to make requests privately on <%= site_name %>, and open up to the public the request and any responses later.
</p>


<dt id="multiple">Can I make the same to request to lots of departments at once? <a href="#multiple">#</a> </dt>

In theory, yes. We ask you to first send a test version of your request to a few
department. Their responses will help you improve the wording of your request,
so that you get the best information when you send the request to all of
the department. There is currently no automated system for sending the request
to the other authorities; you must copy and paste it by hand.



<dt id="offsite">I made a request off the site, how do I upload it to the archive? <a href="#offsite">#</a> </dt>

<%= site_name %> is an archive of requests made through the site,
and does not try to be an archive of all requests made under the Code on Access to Information. We'll never support uploading
other requests. For one thing, we wouldn't be able to verify the other responses. If this really matters to you,
you can always make the same request again via <%= site_name %>.
